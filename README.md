Reminder to group:

Everytime if the app does not run, just delete the node modules and package.lock on both frontend and backend. Run "npm i"
to reinstall the modules.

To push files you should be outside of the backend and frontend folders.

And when runnning the app, go to the backend folder and type "npm run dev". It will run the frontend and the backend.
